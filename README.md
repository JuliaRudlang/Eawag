This repository will hold some useful scripts potentially used for hydrological data analysis or just data analysis in general.

At the very begining only the data collection and pre processing of streamflow is being done, therefore so far there are some usefull scripts showing how to download and pre process daily streamflow information using Pandas, Geopandas, Selenium and other Python libraries.
